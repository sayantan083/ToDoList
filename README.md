This is a to do list app with active mongodb database and hosted by heroku server.
You can visit:

https://agile-brook-45911.herokuapp.com/ 

to check out its working.

You ill see a page with heading "Today". You can add new list by just adding '/' and name of the new list.
For eg: https://agile-brook-45911.herokuapp.com/home will create a new list with heading 'Home'. 
Whatever name u put as heading after the /(slash) it will automatically convert into capitalized version i.e home will be converted into Home.
